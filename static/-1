But now, the \r\n75-year-old Greenspan faces an agonizing challenge: an abrupt economic \r\nslowdown that neither he nor anyone else fully understands. All of Greenspan\x01,\r\ns training and experience have taught him how to cope with conventional \r\ndownturns. And so far, he\x01,s dealing with this one in the conventional manner\x01*\r\nby cutting short-term interest rates in quick but measured steps. That may \r\nwell prove to be the right course. But there\x01,s a risk that this downturn is \r\ndifferent and that far steeper cuts in interest rates are needed to keep the \r\nNew Economy from tumbling into a long and painful recession. \r\nIn short, Alan Greenspan is feeling the heat of a market in tatters and an \r\neconomy that, by some measures, appears to be on the brink. And after riding \r\ntriumphantly astride the economic boom times, his very legacy is suddenly at \r\nstake. \r\n? \r\n\r\nASIA COVER STORY: ASIA\x01,S BIG CHILL \r\nCaught between Japan\x01,s weak-yen policy and the steep U.S. downturn, the \r\nregion\x01,s fragile economies may see their recent gains swept away \r\nBy Brian Bremner in Tokyo, with Frederick Balfour in Bangkok, Michael Shari \r\nin Singapore, Moon Ihlwan in Seoul, and Pete Engardio in New York \r\n\r\nThe U.S. is clearly worried about Japan falling into a catastrophic slide.?? \r\nBut, Washington may not have a clear view of another huge problem: How \r\ndecisions in Tokyo could undermine the precarious economic state of other \r\nAsian nations.?? In South Korea and also in Southeast Asia, the export-led \r\nrecovery of the past two years is starting to slow because of the downturn in \r\nthe U.S. economy.?? Growth in Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and \r\nIndonesia is expected to slow this year to between 3% and 4%.?? The last \r\nthing these economies need is to compete for a dwindling export market with a \r\nJapan now reliant on a weaker yen.?? Many of the economies of East and \r\nSoutheast Asia are trying to shake off a triple blow: The U.S. slowdown is \r\nputting a dent in exports.? Second, Japan is yanking investment from the \r\nregion, and now there\x01,s the yen threat.? Finally, China is soaking up a \r\ngrowing slice of foreign investment, a trend that will accelerate once it \r\nenters the World Trade Organization. \r\n\r\n? \r\nASIA IS CATCHING THE JAPANESE DISEASE \r\nCommentary by Pete Engardio \r\n\r\nIt\x01,s a terrible malady for young economies.? The symptoms: banks that have \r\nmoney but don\x01,t lend.? Lots of exports but no profits.? A teaming workforce \r\nwith dim prospects.? Politicians who know urgent measures are needed but who \r\nwon\x01,t act. Call it Japan disease \x01) and it\x01,s starting to set in across the \r\nonce-booming emerging markets of East Asia.?? Unfortunately, East Asia has \r\nnot used the nearly four years since its financial meltdown wisely.? Lulled \r\nby a U.S.-driven export boom and a short-lived bounce in equity markets, the \r\nregion has failed to finish the reforms that could have cleansed their \r\nfinancial system of billions of dollars of nonperforming assets.??? Most of \r\nAsia can arrest Japan disease before paralysis sets in. But politicians seem \r\nto have lost their will to force sales of distressed assets, close failed \r\nbanks, and open their markets wider to foreign investors. \r\n? \r\n\r\nHAS GERMANY JUMPED THE RAILS? \r\nGermany\x01,s stalled reforms are slowing growth \r\nBy Jack Ewing in Frankfurt, with Christine Tierney in Frankfurt and Carol \r\nMatlack in Paris \r\n\r\nSince its last recession ended a decade ago, the Germany economy has \r\nstruggled to get out of first gear.? Growth averaged a mediocre 1.4% in the \r\nl990s.?? Economists, business people and politicians thought the sorry \r\nperformance was a temporary product of West Germany\x01,s costly and badly \r\nmanaged reunification with the ex-Communist East.? But what if they are \r\nwrong?? There have been worrying economic indicators, including nine months \r\nof sinking business confidence, an uptick in unemployment and a collapse in \r\ncar sales.? Germany\x01,s 82 million people account for a third of gross domestic \r\nproduct among euro countries.? No regional boom is possible without them.? \r\nOptimists think its slower growth is a temporary effect of economic malaise \r\nin the U.S., Japan and other world markets.? Pessimists think the problems \r\nrelate to Germany\x01,s persistent welfare state, its coddled workers, maybe even \r\nits risk-averse culture.?? Some tough times lie ahead \x01) for Germany, and for \r\nthe entire Continent. \r\n? \r\n\r\nRATES: EUROPE NEEDS A LIFT-OFF, TOO \r\nCommentary by David Fairlamb \r\n\r\nThe economy of the 12-nation euro zone is slowing, just like its counterparts \r\nin the U.S. and Asia. But don\x01,t look to the European Central Bank to follow \r\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve with interest rate cuts just yet. The monetary \r\nconservatives who dominate its 18-member governing council see their role as \r\nfighting inflation rather than stimulating growth. So with prices rising at \r\nan annualized 2.6%\x01*well above the 2% upper limit the ecb says is consistent \r\nwith price stability\x01*the central bankers aren\x01,t in a rush to push the price \r\nof money down below the current 4.75 But there are plenty of reasons why it \r\nshould. A cut now would give the European economy a much needed boost. Euro \r\nzone growth peaked at only 3.5% last summer and will likely fall to 2.8% for \r\nall of 2001.? Tax cuts worth 0.8% of the euro zone\x01,s gross domestic product \r\nhave bolstered domestic demand a bit, but not enough to make up for the \r\neffects of the global slowdown. The ECB insists Europe won\x01,t be badly hurt by \r\nthe economic downturn in the U.S. and East Asia. But businesspeople aren\x01,t \r\nconvinced. \r\n? \r\n\r\nTHE WHITE KNIGHT RIDES AGAIN IN ARGENTINA \r\nBut can Domingo Cavallo cure what ails the economy? \r\nBy Colin Barraclough in Buenos Aires, with bureau reports \r\n\r\nOn Mar. 20, Argentines awoke to the news that the 54-year-old Harvard \r\nUniversity-trained economist who rescued their country from hyperinflation \r\nmore than a decade ago was back in his old job. Cavallo is the third man to \r\nhold the post of Economy Minister in as many weeks.? To win the support of \r\nopposition politicians, Cavallo must take a different tack than L?pez Murphy. \r\nCavallo has already abandoned his predecessor\x01,s plan to push through \r\ndraconian spending cuts. Instead, he aims to narrow Argentina\x01,s fiscal \r\ndeficit by $3 billion this year by rekindling growth, thereby boosting tax \r\ncollection. Possible measures include cuts in some corporate tax rates to \r\npromote the reinvestment of profits, and a reduction in banks\x01, reserve \r\nrequirements, which would free up money for loans. \r\n? \r\n\r\nWHO\x01,S KILLING ERICSSON?? ITS OWNERS \r\nShareholders have no say under its ownership system \r\nBy Stanley Reed in London, with Ariane Sains in Stockholm \r\n\r\nSweden\x01,s Ericsson has just two main owners, the Wallenberg family and a group \r\nof holding companies and a fund connected to Handelsbanken, a Stockholm bank, \r\nmaintaining an iron grip with a minimal amount of capital.? They do so by \r\nholding Ericsson A shares, which have 1,000 votes more than the B shares of \r\nwhich foreign shareholders have a majority.?? Now that Ericsson is struggling \r\nin global markets, a quick turnaround is needed.? The current two-tier stock \r\nsystem should be reviewed. \r\n? \r\n\r\nTHE BANK OF JAPAN\x01,S REAL MESSAGE: REFORM NOW \r\nCommentary by Brian Bremner in Tokyo \r\n\r\nOn Mar. 19, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami appeared to abruptly reverse \r\ncourse by announcing measures that will effectively drive the overnight call \r\nrate back down to zero and pump up the money supply to push the consumer \r\nprice index up. Markets are now abuzz with speculation that Japan will \r\ndeliberately ramp up inflation past 3%, and that Hayami is a convert to the \r\ncause of fast reflation. But Hayami has not given up on the other part of his \r\nagenda: to press for real restructuring inside the banks and corporations. So \r\nHayami is signaling that he will ease up on his hard-money ways in exchange \r\nfor some real action by the banks: \x01&While we are doing our part, we hope the \r\ngovernment and the financial system will do what\x01,s necessary on their side,\x018 \r\nsays Deputy BOJ Governor Yutaka Yamaguchi in an interview with BusinessWeek. \r\n? \r\n\r\nRUMBLE OVER TOKYO \r\nAs Airbus aggressively pitches its superjumbo, Boeing moves to protect its \r\nturf \r\nBy Stanley Holmes in Seattle, with? Chester Dawson in Tokyo and Carol Matlack \r\nin Paris \r\n\r\nFor nearly 50 years, Boeing and Japanese airlines JAL, All Nippon, and Japan \r\nAir System have had a fruitful business relationship, thanks in part to the \r\naircraft maker\x01,s deference to Japanese customs. Boeing\x01,s planes now account \r\nfor 84% of Japan\x01,s commercial fleets, the world\x01,s third-largest national air \r\nmarket after the U.S. and China. From 1970 to 1998, jal alone spent $14.4 \r\nbillion on those planes. But that lead is now under fierce attack from Boeing\x01,\r\ns archrival, Airbus Industrie. Japan has become the key battleground as the \r\nEuropean aircraft consortium seeks to launch its superjumbo A380 jet, which \r\ncan hold 555 to 800 passengers. The Airbus offensive will force Boeing, which \r\nrecently announced it will move its headquarters out of Seattle as part of a \r\nmajor corporate overhaul, to fight like never before. \r\n? \r\n\r\nIS A NEW WAR BREWING IN THE BALKANS? \r\nInternational Outlook by Christopher Condon in Budapest, with Ren,e Cordes in \r\nBrussels, Heidi Dawley in London, and Stan Crock in Washington \r\n\r\nIt\x01,s another Balkans mess, and it could prove to be a dangerous test for \r\nPresident George W. Bush and the 37,000 NATO troops stationed in Kosovo. \r\nAfter six days of fighting between insurgents and Macedonian forces near the \r\ncity of Tetovo from Mar. 14-19, NATO officials announced plans to bolster \r\npatrols on the Kosovo border with Macedonia.? Both European and U.S. \r\ndiplomats hope Macedonian forces will subdue the rebels. But if the fighting \r\nkeeps up, pressure will grow on NATO to play a more active role. That could \r\ninvolve a controversial decision to send NATO troops to combat rebels in \r\nMacedonia. Washington, however, wants to avoid an escalation.? Still, \r\nstrangely, NATO troops could find themselves increasingly under fire from the \r\nvery people they were sent to protect\x01*ethnic Albanians. With no quick \r\nsolution to the latest Balkan conflict in sight, that\x01,s not a pleasant place \r\nto be. \r\n? \r\n\r\nSWISSAIR: PINNING ITS HOPES ON \x01+SUPER MARIO\x01, \r\nThe new CEO will have tough time fighting the flag carrier \r\nBy Christine Tierney in Frankfurt and Carol Matlack in Paris \r\n\r\nIt has been a shock to investors to witness Swissair\x01,s mounting disarray.?? \r\nSAirGroup\x01,s CEO Philippe Bruggisser, who had charted the expansion strategy \r\nthat plunged the company into the red last year, has been jettisoned.? Then \r\nMoritz Suter, the airline division chief bailed out, and then 9 of the \r\ncompany\x01,s 10 supervisory board members quit, including Chairman and interim \r\nCEO Eric Honegger.??? Enter Super Mario.? The new CEO, Mario Corti, is the \r\nchief financial officer of Swiss food giant Nestle and the only board member \r\nleft at the airline.? It\x01,s not that SAirGroup\x01,s expansion strategy was \r\ntotally flawed.? SAirGroup went wrong when it invested heavily in second-tier \r\npartners, many of which are in trouble.??? Corti is expected to unveil a new \r\nstrategy in a special shareholders\x01, meting in September. \r\n? \r\n\r\nRUSSIA: A LITTLE-KNOWN PLAYER\x01,S GRIP ON NATURAL GAS \r\nGas supplier Itera\x01,s clout extends across the old Soviet empire \r\nBy Catherine Belton in Moscow, with Dan Carney in Washington \r\n\r\nWestern investors \x01) especially energy giants \x01) are likely to be hearing more \r\nabout a mysterious Russian company called Itera.? It is the fourth-largest \r\nholder of gas reserves on the planet with a virtual monopoly on gas trading \r\nin two key former Soviet republics, Georgia and Ukraine, that lie at the \r\ngateway for transporting the region\x01,s energy resources to the West.?? Itera \r\nPresident Igor V. Makarov says he holds the key to the Caspian for any \r\nforeign energy company wanting to get a foothold in the region \x01) considered \r\none of the hottest oil plays anywhere.? \x01&Today, we are the only company that \r\ncan turn joint ventures with U.S. enterprises into real businesses,\x018 he says \r\n\x01) and that\x01,s quite a claim.?? But even as Itera seeks recognition and funding \r\nfrom the West, law enforcement officials in Europe and the U.S. are \r\nscrutinizing Itera\'s activities for possible money-laundering.?? Itera\x01,s rise \r\nfrom barter trader to global-gas giant is raising questions inside Russia, \r\ntoo. \r\n? \r\n\r\nA SOCIALIST WHO\x01,S BETTING ON THE NEW ECONOMY \r\nPresident Lagos talks about how to keep Chile on track \r\nQ&A with Mexico Bureau Chief Geri Smith and Chile correspondent Louise Egan \r\n\r\nRicardo Lagos, the first Socialist to rule Chile since the 1973 military \r\noverthrow of Salvador Allende, recently completed his first year in office, \r\namid growing concerns that the country\x01,s much-vaunted economic \x01&miracle\x018 is \r\nlosing its luster. Lagos, 63, who holds a doctorate in economics from Duke \r\nUniversity, says that Chile, which led Latin American nations in adopting \r\nfree-market reforms two decades ago, must now bet big on attracting high-tech \r\nindustries. He also is pushing hard to seal a free-trade agreement with the \r\nU.S. On Mar. 19, Lagos sat down with Mexico Bureau Chief Geri Smith and Chile \r\ncorrespondent Louise Egan in his office in La Moneda, the presidential \r\npalace, to discuss his plans for what remains of his six-year term. \r\n? \r\n\r\nINDIA: DON\x01,T LET SCANDAL DERAIL REFORM \r\nCommentary by Manjeet Kripalani \r\n\r\nThe Indian government stands on the brink of collapse. The event that did the \r\ndamage: a sting operation by an online magazine, which caught leading \r\npoliticians and military officials on camera accepting bribes in connection \r\nwith what they thought were military contracts. Defense Minister George \r\nFernandes has since quit, along with the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party. \r\nRaucous opposition legislators closed Parliament for six days, insisting that \r\nthe government step down.? The administration should be embarrassed. But it \r\nwould be a huge mistake for the opposition to initiate a new era of political \r\nturmoil. The principal casualty would be much needed reform.? Yet India \r\ndesperately needs to get its house in order. Last year, it took in only $2.6 \r\nbillion in foreign direct investment.? Most important are the proposed \r\nreforms of the labor laws, which for the first time would permit companies \r\nwith fewer than 1,000 employees to hire and fire without government \r\npermission. Freed from these restrictions, business owners could invest in \r\npromising new ventures, instead of wallowing in sunset industries. So instead \r\nof seeking to stall change, the opposition would do well to embrace it. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \r\nBusinessWeek presents: \r\ne.biz Live: Europe \r\n7-8 June, 2001 \r\nThe Hilton Hotel, Park Lane, London\r\n \r\n\r\nFor program details or to register, visit our website at \r\nconferences.businessweek.com/2001/ebizeu or call +44 (0) 207 251 2030. \r\n\r\nFuture BusinessWeek Executive Programs: \r\n- Telecom Summit 2001: Broadband Connections, April 25 - 27, 2001 \x01) The \r\nFairmont Hotel, Dallas, Texas \r\n- The BusinessWeek CIO Summit: Bridging the Technology/Strategy Divide, May \r\n10-11, 2001 --Boston, MA \r\n- Breakthrough: A CEO Retreat, June 27-29, 2001 -- Rancho Bernardo Inn, San \r\nDiego, CA \r\n\r\nFor more information see http://conferences.businessweek.com/ \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \r\n? \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: NEW ANSWERS TO NEW PROBLEMS \r\nEconomic Viewpoint by Jeffrey E. Garten \r\n\r\nFor more than a century, our system for protecting intellectual property \r\nrights has fostered the creativity of artists and inventors. But now it is \r\nbeing challenged by two major global forces: the Internet, which can act as a \r\ngigantic international copying machine, and a global health crisis in which \r\npatented miracle drugs are too expensive for developing countries. It is time \r\nto reexamine how the intellectual property rights regime works.?? There are \r\nmany issues to be addressed. Is there a way to better codify the space for \r\nprivate use and experimentation on the Internet? Should governments use their \r\npowers of eminent domain to buy up critical pharmaceutical patents and better \r\ndistribute the underlying products? There may be much better approaches than \r\nthese, but relying only on relentless enforcement of existing laws isn\x01,t one \r\nof them. \r\n? \r\n\r\nPATIENCE INVESTORS, THE FED IS NOT DONE \r\nBut economic data, not the stock market, will dictate policy \r\nBusiness Outlook by James C. Cooper and Kathleen Madigan \r\n\r\nAt nine yards long, the Federal Reserve\x01,s oval table is too big for poker. \r\nBut on Mar. 20, policymakers entered into a high-stakes game. The pot: an \r\neconomic rebound in the second half.? At its second policy meeting of 2001, \r\nthe Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by a half-point, to 5%, \r\neschewing Wall Street\x01,s clamor for a supersize cut of three-quarters of a \r\npoint.? In effect, the Fed made it clear that it will not follow the stock \r\nmarket\x01,s timetable for policy decisions. The Fed\x01,s action implicitly says \r\nthat economic conditions did not justify a larger, more radical move.? \r\nInvestors were so focused on the idea that \x01&size matters\x018 that they \r\ncompletely ignored the meeting\x01,s most obvious positive: The Fed left open the \r\ndoor for more cuts\x01*perhaps even before its next meeting on May 15.? The key \r\nremark was: \x01&In these circumstances, when economic conditions could be \r\nevolving rapidly, the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments \r\nclosely.\x018 That language should sound familiar. It is similar to what the Fed \r\nsaid after its Dec. 19 meeting, prior to the surprise intermeeting cut on \r\nJan. 3. It\x01,s Fedspeak for: \x01&We may not wait until May 15.\x018 \r\n? \r\n\r\nA DEFINITE \x01+SELL\x01,?? GIMME 100 SHARES \r\nBrokerage calls keep missing the mark \x01) and then some \r\nBy Mara DerHovanesian in New York \r\n\r\nWho says you can\x01,t make money by following a Wall Street analyst\x01,s \r\nrecommendations? Just do exactly the opposite of what they say, and you\x01,ll \r\nmake out like a bandit.? And we\x01,re not talking about the stocks these \r\nanalysts are plugging, either. Granted, the Street has a tough time telling \r\ninvestors to sell stocks anyway, but when they do, you\x01,d think it would be a \r\nno-brainer to pick a loser in this bear market. Instead, these calls are \r\ndefying gravity.? BusinessWeek takes a look at how Credit Suisse First Boston \r\nhas fared with its sell recommendations so far this year. First, only 11 U.S. \r\nstocks of 1,328 stocks Credit Suisse covers are on the sell list, according \r\nto Zacks Investment Research. The irony is that many of those stocks have \r\noutperformed the company\x01,s buy recommendations. Credit Suisse isn\x01,t the only \r\none with egg on its face. UBS Warburg has four current \x01&reduce\x018 ratings on \r\nthe 1,015 U.S. stocks it covers. Three of those\x01*KMart, DaimlerChrysler, and \r\nNew Plan Excel Realty Trust\x01*are up 64.2%, 9.3% and 17.9% this year through \r\nMar. 20. \r\n? \r\n\r\nDON\x01,T BET THE BANK ON EARLY-HOURS TRADING \r\nConventional wisdom aside, futures aren\x01,t crystal balls \r\nBy Pallavi Gogoi in Chicago, with Susan Zegel in New York \r\n\r\nBy jumping in early, are fund managers helping to shape market trading that \r\nday? Not really. The small group of big investors around the world who trade \r\nin stock index futures prior to the U.S. markets opening aren\x01,t even setting \r\nthe stage for whether the equity markets will rise or fall in the first 15 \r\nminutes of trading. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, repeated daily on \r\nCNBC, Bloomberg Radio, and local TV and radio stations\x01*that the futures \r\npredict the day\x01,s market performances\x01*an examination of the data by \r\nBusinessWeek shows hardly any correlation. That may come as a big surprise to \r\nmarket players who\x01,ve been taking it as an article of faith that the futures \r\noffer a solid guide to the day\x01,s trading. To some longtime traders, the lack \r\nof predictive power in the futures is not so surprising. They say the number \r\nof investors playing the markets in the big index contracts is small. \r\nNonetheless, some investors swear by them. \r\n? \r\n\r\nNO CARTWHEELS FOR HANDSPRING \r\nRich rivals race to erase the company\x01,s handheld edge \r\nBy Cliff Edwards in Mountain View, Calif. \r\n\r\nThe handheld market has become one of the fastest-growing corners of techdom. \r\nResearcher IDC expects sales of the gizmos to soar 52% annually until 2004, \r\nto $10.7 billion from $2 billion in 2000, far outstripping PC growth. And \r\nHandspring is becoming a player to beat. In the past 18 months, the company \r\nhas sold more than 1 million of its Visor computers, giving it 28% of the \r\nhandheld market in February, up from zilch a year earlier. Now, Handspring \r\nhas to deliver a convincing second act\x01*something it\x01,s attempting with its new \r\nVisor Edge, introduced Mar. 12. Problem is, the company may be losing its \r\ninnovation lead. Handhelds are outgrowing their roots as electronic \r\norganizers and mutating into Net appliances and wireless communication tools. \r\nThat could tip the advantage to players using Microsoft\x01,s PocketPC operating \r\nsystem, a slim variant of Windows that makes the Palm operating system \r\nHandspring uses look long in the tooth. \r\n? \r\n\r\nA GRAB FOR CONTROL OF FORMULA ONE \r\nUpfront by Christine Tierney \r\n\r\nMercedes and Ferrari, the carmakers with the leading auto racing teams, are \r\nthreatening to quit Formula One and form an alternative racing group if they \r\ncan\x01,t buy in. The brouhaha comes as control of the Formula One holding \r\ncompany is about to change hands, from F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to German \r\nmedia magnate Leo Kirch.? But the Euro racers want a stake, too. The group, \r\nalso including BMW, Jaguar, and Renault, had been talking to Ecclestone about \r\ngetting into the biz themselves before Kirch came on the scene. They worry \r\nKirch will try to boost his KirchPayTV network by restricting Formula One \r\nraces, which are now on commercial channels, to the pay channel. The \r\ncarmakers have invested billions in Formula One, and they insist the event be \r\nprofessionally run and freely broadcast to give them maximum public exposure. \r\nMercedes chief J_rgen Hubbert expects negotiations with Kirch to begin soon: \r\n\x01&We\x01,ve sent a clear message.\x018? If Kirch balks...well, there\x01,s always the 1978 \r\nprecedent in the U.S., when team owners broke from the U.S. Auto Club to form \r\nChampionship Auto Racing Teams. \r\n? \r\n\r\nHANDBAGS, COGNAC \x01) AND WATER \r\nBy Gerry Khermouch \r\n\r\nWhat\x01,s the latest trend item for your Louis Vuitton bag? Glac,au Vitamin \r\nWater or Fruit Water. The chic-set drinks, which sell for about $1.50, are \r\nmade by tiny Energy Brands in Whitestone, N.Y.

Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have dropped from a five-year high \r\nof 8.64% in May to 6.82%\x01*near the lowest level in two years. And that\x01,s \r\nspurring a refinancing boom. Though there are risks in the boom\x01*overindebted \r\nhomeowners could be taking on too much debt\x01*for now, many economists argue \r\nthat it is offering a much needed boost to consumer spending. And that could \r\ngive a hand to the ailing economy as well. \x01&This is the best way to get money \r\ninto people\x01,s purses and pocketbooks immediately,\x018 says Mark M. Zandi, chief \r\neconomist at market forecaster Economy.com Inc. \r\n? \r\n\r\nSURPRISE\x01*THE TECH INDUSTRY IS A CYCLICAL \r\nMeltdown Redux: 1985 was bad, but this time more industries are affected \r\nBy Peter Burrows, with Jim Kerstetter and Linda Himelstein in Silicon Valley \r\n\r\nIt\x01,s a frightening picture, all right. Hordes of brash high-tech startups, \r\nall intent on grabbing a 20% share of vast emerging markets, getting \r\nmassacred, their dreams crashing back to earth. Even the most respected tech \r\ncompanies are being forced to lay off staffers and slash spending as earnings \r\nfall miles short of analysts\x01, projections. The press is stuffed with scary \r\n\x01&end of history\x018 articles about the death of the tech revolution. Venture \r\ncapitalists, who just months before were throwing around money like so much \r\nbirdseed, are nowhere to be found. Sound familiar? All this happened back in \r\n1985, in what was then the biggest tech meltdown ever. Yes, as the world has \r\nagain learned painfully, tech can be a very cyclical business.? 1985 offers a \r\nreminder that stretches of tech prosperity have always been sandwiched \r\nbetween deep, painful valleys. Thanks to the cash pumped into everything from \r\nfiber-optic parts to huge computers in recent years, this could be the \r\ndeepest valley yet. \r\n? \r\n\r\nWHILE WASHINGTON FIDDLES\x01( \r\nWhy the Beltway hasn\x01,t gone into panic mode \r\nCommentary by Lee Walczak, with Rich Miller, Howard Gleckman, Richard S. \r\nDunham, and Lorraine Woellert in Washington D.C., and Ann Therese Palmer in \r\nChicago \r\n\r\nWhat\x01,s Washington doing while the world\x01,s financial fabric frays and risks of \r\na painful U.S. downturn grow? Debating. Mulling. Maneuvering. Even as an \r\nincreasingly urgent chorus of voices outside the Beltway insists that the \r\nBush Administration and Congress need to come up with a fiscal stimulus \r\npackage pronto, few in Washington are acting with anything remotely \r\nsuggestive of impending danger. Instead, Bush continues to push for a tax cut \r\nthat most agree won\x01,t benefit the economy for at least a year, and Congress \r\nis content to play political \x01&gotcha.\x018? Bizarre as it may seem to many with \r\nbusiness ties, the gulf between the real economy and Washington\x01,s insular \r\npolitical culture has seldom been greater. Up to now, many of the city\x01,s pols \r\nseemed confident that a benign spirit\x01*Saint Alan of C Street\x01*would ward off \r\nthe evil of a recession. But over at the Federal Reserve, Greenspan\x01,s halo \r\nhas slipped.?? Bush\x01,s advisers are having intense discussions over what one \r\naide describes as a \x01&rifle-shot\x018 rate cut that would provide quicker \r\nstimulus. Also being explored: a one-time tax rebate that could put money \r\ninto consumers\x01, hands fast. \r\n? \r\n\r\nA \x01&FIRST FRIEND\x018 WITH CLOUT \r\nCommerce Secretary Don Evans\x01, longtime ties to Bush give him unusual access \r\nBy Paul Magnusson in Washington \r\n? \r\nCommerce Secretary Donald L. Evans has two jobs in Washington. The official \r\none comes with a government limo, a spacious paneled office, a tropical fish \r\ntank, and a $3 billion budget. The second is a round-the-clock role as First \r\nFriend.? That easy intimacy makes Evans, 54, potentially one of the most \r\npowerful Commerce chiefs in many years. As Bush\x01,s campaign chairman, he \r\nraised a record-breaking $100 million for his pal, a job that put the Texan \r\non a first-name basis with many corporate chieftains. But in his first major \r\ninterview, the Commerce Secretary insists that he\x01,s leaving the world of \r\npolitical fund-raising behind. His new concerns: helping to sell the big Bush \r\ntax cut, battling unfair trade practices abroad aimed at industries such as \r\nsteel and aerospace, and boosting the government\x01,s long-range research \r\nefforts. \r\n? \r\n\r\nEND OF THE CEO GRAVY TRAIN? \r\nSurprise! Exec pay seems to be slipping\x01*though some underperformers are doing \r\nremarkably well \r\nBy Louis Lavelle in New York \r\n\r\nFor many of the nation\x01,s chief executive officers, 2000 will likely be a year \r\nto forget. After nearly five years of double-digit growth in CEO \r\ncompensation, early indications are that their pay actually fell last year. \r\nOf the 130 corporate proxies so far available for the biggest U.S. companies, \r\nthe compensation of the 15 best-paid CEOs shows the slowing economy has taken \r\na toll on earnings. When salary, bonus, and options exercised last year were \r\ntaken into account, compensation for those CEOs fell nearly 5% from 1999. The \r\nreason: The market\x01,s nosedive made it a bad time for many corporate kingpins \r\nto exercise their options, often the largest part of remuneration.? According \r\nto a proxy analysis by Standard & Poor\x01,s Institutional Market Services, a \r\ndivision of The McGraw-Hill Companies, total compensation for the 15 highest \r\nearners averaged $88.7 million, a $4.4 million drop. \r\n? \r\n\r\nTHE BEST SHAREHOLDERS CAN GET? \r\nThe AG-Prudential deal isn\x01,t sweet, but there\x01,s no white knight in sight \r\nBy Emily Thornton, with Pamela L. Moore in New York and Heidi Dawley in \r\nLondon \r\n\r\nEver since American General Corp. Chairman and CEO Robert M. Devlin first \r\nannounced a stock-swap with British insurer Prudential PLC on Mar. 12, then \r\nvalued at $26.5 billion, Wall Street has thought that the Houston insurer\x01,s \r\nshareholders were getting the short end of the stick. Prudential\x01,s stock \r\nprice has tumbled 16% since, and American General\x01,s about 4%, thus crushing \r\nthe premium American General shareholders will receive to 5% from 22%. And \r\nthat could put the kibosh on the merger.? Clearly, this is not what \r\nshareholders hoped for. Still, this deal may be the best shareholders can \r\nget. When the Prudential deal was first announced, Wall Street was abuzz with \r\nrumors that heavyweights such as Sanford I. Weill at Citigroup or Maurice R. \r\n\x01&Hank\x018 Greenberg at American International Group? Inc. might swoop in with a \r\ncounterbid. Unlikely, say investment bankers, because American General has \r\nhad informal talks with both in the past two years. Devlin insists \r\ndiscussions were never serious enough to reach his board. \r\n? \r\n\r\nSOUTHWEST: AFTER KELLEHER, MORE BLUE SKIES \r\nSouthwest\x01,s model shone in an embattled industry\x01*and it looks brighter than \r\never \r\nCommentary by Wendy Zellner \r\n\r\nIn three decades of building low-fare legend Southwest Airlines Co., CEO \r\nHerbert D. Kelleher has made nary a misstep. Until Mar. 19, the one chink in \r\nhis armor appeared to be the question of how Southwest would replace him. \r\nFinally, the answer: Two Southwest veterans steeped in the company\x01,s \r\ntraditions will man the controls.? On June 19, James F. Parker, 54, general \r\ncounsel, and Colleen C. Barrett, 56, executive vice-president for customers, \r\nwill become CEO and President, respectively. And as Parker and Barrett might \r\ntell you, they are inheriting a devilishly simple playbook: Keep costs down. \r\nFocus on customers. Keep employees happy. And keep it simple. While Southwest \r\nhas tweaked its formula over the years\x01*adding more long-distance flights, for \r\ninstance\x01*it\x01,s still mainly a point-to-point, short-hop airline that uses one \r\naircraft type to simplify training and maintenance. \r\n? \r\n\r\nBUYING A NEW PC?? NOT SO FAST \r\nUpgrading to Microsoft\x01,s coming XP system will be such a challenge that it \r\nmakes more sense to wait until new computers come with it \r\nTechnology & You by Stephen H. Wildstrom \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Corp.\x01,s Windows XP, which is just entering its final stage of \r\nlarge-scale field testing, is the most important consumer software product to \r\nappear since the Windows 95 operating system. The prospect of waiting for XP \r\nposes a difficult choice for anyone in the market for a new computer. Nearly \r\nall consumer PCs sold today are outfitted with Windows ME, the last gasp of \r\nthe Windows 95 line. It seems reasonable to buy a new computer with Windows \r\nME and move to XP when it\x01,s available. But I don\x01,t recommend it. Why? The \r\nupgrade will be challenging. Even moving from Windows 95 to 98 was often \r\ndifficult, and going from ME to XP will be a much bigger transition. \r\nMicrosoft and battered computer makers will hate me for saying this, but I \r\nsuggest that you make your old computer last nine more months or so until XP \r\nis ready. \r\n? \r\n\r\nCAN GM\x01,S JOHN DEVINE KEEP HIS PROMISE? \r\nThe new CFO pledges bigger earnings, but much depends on building sales in a \r\nslowing economy \r\nBy David Welch in Detroit \r\n\r\nOnly someone as confident as John Devine, the new vice-chairman and chief \r\nfinancial officer of General Motors Corp., would promise that America\x01,s \r\nlargest auto maker will earn $2.3 billion this year, about a third more than \r\nsome analysts predict. And only someone as respected as Devine would be taken \r\nseriously. \r\nChief Executive G. Richard Wagoner Jr., a 23-year GM veteran, broke with \r\ntradition by hiring Devine\x01*rarely has GM gone outside to fill a senior job. \r\nDevine could even become chief operating officer in the next few years, \r\naccording to GM insiders. As one board member puts it: \x01&You don\x01,t bring in a \r\nguy like John Devine and expect it to be business as usual.\x018 Good thing for \r\nGM. The company that once was regarded as the country\x01,s most innovative \r\ncarmaker has been in decline for three decades. Its U.S. market share has \r\nfallen from 33% in 1995 to 28% last year.? A lot has to go right at GM\x01*and in \r\nthe economy\x01*for Devine\x01,s predictions to come true. \r\n? \r\n\r\nTHE SEC IS TOO HUSH-HUSH \r\nCommentary by Christopher H. Schmitt \r\n\r\nWhen the Securities & Exchange Commission issued rules in January to shore up \r\nthe independence of outside directors who oversee mutual funds, some SEC \r\nwatchers were caught by surprise. Why? One reason: The commissioners didn\x01,t \r\nmeet in public. Under former Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., the SEC went out of \r\nits way to shake up the status quo and avoid donning the mantle of apologist \r\nfor the industry it oversees.? And yet the SEC hasn\x01,t changed its own \r\npractices much. There\x01,s more that needs fixing than the SEC\x01,s nonmeeting \r\nmeetings. In a confusing process closed to public view, the SEC handles \r\nthousands of exemption and guidance requests each year. It\x01,s supposed to make \r\nthem\x01*and its replies\x01*public, though it doesn\x01,t always do so promptly. Of \r\ncourse, there is a need for some confidentiality\x01*and exemptions and guidance, \r\ntoo. But that doesn\x01,t mean the SEC can\x01,t be more forthcoming about its \r\nbusiness. \r\n? \r\n\r\nMcLATTE AND CROISSANT? \r\nUpfront by Michael Arndt \r\n\r\nJust when it? seemed McDonald\x01,s couldn\x01,t possibly cram another restaurant \r\ninto the U.S., the burger giant has come up with a new way to expand: coffee \r\nbars. BusinessWeek has learned McDonald\x01,s will open its first,? McCaf,, in \r\nChicago\x01,s Loop in April. It will sell pastries, perhaps prewrapped \r\nsandwiches, and premium coffee.? Sound familiar, Starbucks fans? But whether \r\naficionados will give up their grande skim latte for a McCappuccino is a good \r\nquestion. McDonald\x01,s won\x01,t say how many McCaf,s it plans, but based on their \r\nsuccess overseas, the rollout could be swift and wide. There are 300 McCaf,s \r\nin 17 countries, from Australia and Japan to Brazil and Greece. Each sits in \r\nor near a McDonald\x01,s, with its own staff and equipment.

In what follows, I will avoid \nboth attacks and praise, and instead focus on key features of international \ntrade and investment that characterize what is taking place in much of the \nworld.\n\nA country, if its dictatorial leader so insists, can set its own prohibitive \ntariff and import structure and reject foreign investment. North Korea and \nVietnam, both nondemocratic, did this for many years, despite the horrible \ncost this policy imposed on national welfare. This isolation is breaking down \nin these two countries, even as it did earlier in China after the death of \nMao, and for much the same reason. Eternal poverty is not a good formula for \nregime continuity.\n\nGuarding economic sovereignty did not take the same absolutist form in most \nother countries, but a profound transformation is taking place in them as \nwell. Import barriers are coming down and attacks against foreign investment \nare being transmuted into searches to attract foreign investment. Mexico, \nbefore its debt collapse in 1982, favored external borrowing over investment \nto obtain foreign exchange, but learned to its dismay that this practice \ncontained its own risks when the debt could not be serviced. The philosophic \nbase of development then changed and foreign investment was actively sought \nas an essential requirement for Mexico to augment its exports. This outlook \nwas the premise of NAFTA. Hugo Ch?vez, the president of Venezuela, rails \nagainst primitive neoliberalism (neoliberalismo salvaje), but nevertheless \nhas kept the country\'s import tariffs relatively low, even as he makes a \ngreat effort to obtain foreign direct investment to develop his country\'s \ntelecommunications and natural gas activities. Ch?vez, so far, has shown a \ntendency to talk like a Marxist, much like Fidel Castro, his romantic icon, \nbut then act like a capitalist.\n\nFor many of the world\'s poorest countries, the primordial problem is not the \nspread of multinational corporations, but their inability to participate in \nthe process. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. Their poverty, \nsmall internal markets, and accompanying political instability make them poor \ndestinations for foreign investment, other than to exploit minerals for \nexport. This does not lead to substantial job creation.\n\nBoth foreign direct investment and international trade are growing more \nrapidly than world economic growth. This is a clear manifestation that the \n"foreign" aspect of the world economy is becoming increasingly important. If \none looks back only 20 years, when the dominant economic model in Latin \nAmerica was to develop behind high import barriers and to downplay the \nimportance of exports, it is startling how much development thinking has \nchanged in that part of the world. East Asia, with its export orientation, \nbecame the model, and not the preachings of those who advised Latin America \nto look inward.\n\nThe bulk of the world\'s trade is carried on by large corporations. This is \nnot a new phenomenon. These same corporations are large investors in foreign \nmanufacturing and service activities. Indeed, the two phenomena-investing and \nproducing in foreign countries and then selling much of the output in still \nother foreign countries, as well as the home market-are inseparable.\n\nInternational trade is increasingly taking place in intermediate rather than \nfinal products-chips for computers, parts for office machinery, engines for \nautomobiles and trucks, cotton and wool fabrics for apparel. Look under the \nhood of your car; the transmission assembly may have elements produced in a \nnumber of countries. The assembly line in Detroit works on a just-in-time \nbasis to receive the material needed from across the border in Windsor, \nOntario-and beware of a slowdown from a customs snafu that leads to a costly \ndisruption in the manufacturing process.\n\nThis goes by the name coproduction. The parts are produced in a variety of \nlocations, assembled in other places, and sold globally. Much of the sales \nare within the same multinational corporation, say, from a parent to a \nsubsidiary (intra-firm trade), or within the same sector (intra-industry \ntrade). As goods pass across borders in this fashion, the absence of border \nimpediments (tariffs, lengthy inspection delays) is crucial, as the \nautomotive example between Windsor and Detroit exemplifies. Hence, the drive \nfor trade negotiations to lower these barriers and the proliferation of \nregional economic integration agreements, such as NAFTA, to legally ensure \nthe absence of delays in a just-in-time world.\n\nEconomic integration and, by extension, the process of globalization, is \ncentered on competition in particular sectors when it comes to production and \nmerchandise trade. What is taking place is a form of division of labor-Adam \nSmith on a regional and global scale. The global aspect is made possible by \ntechnology, advances in communication and transportation, and by financing \nfar more vast than anything seen before. Corporations take many factors into \naccount when setting up complementary plants in foreign countries, such as \nsize of the domestic market, the availability and price of labor, the cost of \ntransportation, and the political stability of the country where the \ninvestment is made. The growth of U.S. coproduction with Mexico was based \nprimarily on two considerations: proximity, and thus low transportation \ncosts; and inexpensive labor. Most foreign direct investment is made among \nindustrial countries, which is evidence that cheap labor is by no means \nalways the dominant criterion. This is evident as well from the paucity of \ninvestment in the world\'s poorest countries.\n\nIf most international trade is conducted by large corporations, what does \nthis imply for the future of small and medium-sized enterprises? In just \nabout all countries, goods and services that are not internationally traded \nare more voluminous than tradables. In addition, many large corporations have \nconcluded that making all inputs in-house is not the most efficient practice \nand instead are subcontracting to independent producers and service \nproviders-and many of these are relatively small enterprises. Their products \nare then exported indirectly, via the exports of the large corporations.\n\nThere is no intent in this discussion to assert that multinational \ncorporations invariably provide their workers with optimal working conditions \nand good salaries and are always careful to avoid environmental degradation \nin their operations. We know that many corporations are not that meticulous, \neven though we also know that wages and working conditions in foreign \ntransplants generally are superior to those of domestic enterprises. We know \nthat foreign trade and investment results in losers in the home countries, \nalthough by now it is clear that there are many more winners. We know that \nthe global spread of business benefits some countries more than others and \nthat some regions of countries prosper while others lag behind. The \nglobalization genie-in the form of investment, trade, financial flows, and \ntechnology advances-is out of the bottle. The challenges are to minimize the \ndownside dangers while exploiting the upside benefits that globalization can \noffer to countries throughout the world.\n\n\nIssues in International Political Economy is published by the William E. \nSimon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on \ninternational public policy issues.
